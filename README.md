## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process in Tableau

1. **Connecting to Data Source**:
   - **Commencing with precision**: Established a seamless connection to the raw CSV files within Tableau, setting the foundation for detailed analysis.

2. **Initial Data Import**:
   - **Foundation laid**: Imported the raw data into Tableau, preparing for an in-depth examination and subsequent transformation.

3. **Preliminary Data Review**:
   - **Identifying discrepancies**: Conducted a thorough initial review using the Data Source tab to spot any issues such as missing values, duplicates, or outliers.

4. **Addressing Missing Values**:
   - **Filling the gaps**: Identified columns with missing data and addressed them by either replacing with appropriate placeholders or crafting calculated fields to manage the missing values.

5. **Eliminating Duplicates**:
   - **Ensuring accuracy**: Developed calculated fields to identify duplicate records and removed them to maintain data integrity.

6. **Data Type Verification**:
   - **Standardizing entries**: Verified and corrected data types for each column, ensuring consistency in dates, numerical values, and strings.

7. **Standardizing Data Formats**:
   - **Uniform consistency**: Ensured consistent data formats across the dataset, particularly standardizing date formats using Tableau's robust functions.

8. **Creating Calculated Fields**:
   - **Deriving key metrics**: Created new calculated fields for essential metrics required for analysis, such as profit margin and average unit price.

9. **Data Blending**:
   - **Integrating sources**: Seamlessly blended multiple data sources to create a cohesive and comprehensive dataset.

10. **Filtering Out Unnecessary Data**:
    - **Streamlining the dataset**: Applied filters to exclude irrelevant or extraneous data, ensuring the dataset remained focused and manageable.

11. **Data Aggregation**:
    - **Synthesizing information**: Aggregated data to the necessary level of detail using Tableau‚Äôs aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG) for a holistic analysis.

12. **Data Validation**:
    - **Ensuring reliability**: Validated the cleaned data by generating preliminary visualizations to check for consistency and accuracy.

13. **Final Review**:
    - **Quality assurance**: Conducted a meticulous final review of the cleaned data, ensuring all issues were addressed and the dataset was primed for insightful analysis.
